"""EXPERIMENTAL (3.x): the `bioscout lab` verb -- video and wearable tracking.

    load_tracking/     training-load tracking (`lab load-report`,
                       `lab add-subject`, and `lab shots` via shot_analysis)
    record/            video capture and pose tracking
    subject_profile.py per-subject video-analysis profiles under
                       ~/.powerlifting_app/subjects

NOT part of the OpenSim/CEINMS pipeline and not stable. Nothing is imported
eagerly -- the tracking stack (cv2, mediapipe) stays unloaded until used.
