Why this file imports bioscout.utils before anything else
--------------------------------------------------------
``analysis.py`` binds ``bioscout.utils`` at module level, and
``bioscout/utils/__init__.py`` in turn imports Subject/Session/Analyse from
``analysis.py`` -- a cycle that only resolves if ``bioscout.utils`` is the one
that starts. While analysis.py lived INSIDE utils/ that was guaranteed for
free: importing ``bioscout.utils.analysis`` runs the parent package's
``__init__`` first. Moving it to ``bioscout.core`` (RESTRUCTURE_PLAN stage 8)
removed that guarantee, so ``import bioscout.core.analysis`` as the very first
bioscout import raised ImportError on ``Analyse``.

Importing utils here restores the invariant explicitly: whichever module of
this package is reached first, ``bioscout.utils`` is fully initialised before
``analysis.py`` starts executing. When utils IS the caller it is already in
sys.modules and this is a no-op.
