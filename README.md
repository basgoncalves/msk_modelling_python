# msk_modelling_python 

This package includes a combination of other packages and custom functions to manipulate and analyse biomechanical data.
Inspired by the MATLAB version of BOPS (Batch OpenSim Processing Scripts) - https://simtk.org/projects/bops/

Biomechanical tools included:
    - BTK               https://biomechanical-toolkit.github.io/docs/Wrapping/Python/_getting_started.html
    - c3dServer         https://www.c3dserver.com/ 
    - opensim           https://simtk-confluence.stanford.edu:8443/display/OpenSim/Scripting+in+Python 

## Installation

1. Download a code interpreter (I recommend visual studio code, but do whatever)

4. Download and install OpenSim (suggest 4.3)
https://simtk.org/frs/?group_id=91
	
5. Configure OpenSim and Python by running bops.py
    for manual setup of opensim go to https://simtk-confluence.stanford.edu:8443/display/OpenSim/Scripting+in+Python
