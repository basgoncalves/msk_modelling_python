 How to Acknowledge Us
---------------------
Acknowledging the CEINMS project helps us and helps you. It allows us to track
our impact, which is essential for securing funding to improve the software and
provide support to our users (you).
If you use the CEINMS, you must acknowledge the CEINMS where appropriate, by 
citing the following paper. 

Pizzolato, C., Lloyd D.G., Sartori, M., Fregly B.J., Ceseracciu E., 
Besier T.F., Reggiani, M., CEINMS: a toolbox to investigate the influence 
of different neural solutions on the prediction of muscle excitation 
and joint moments during dynamic motor tasks, Journal of Biomechanics (submitted)

In addition, if you use the EMG-driven operation mode on single-dof models could 
you please cite

Lloyd D.G., Besier T.F. An EMG-driven musculoskeletal model to estimate
muscle forces and knee joint moments in vivo, Journal of Biomechanics 
36(6):765-776, 2003.

or if you use the EMG-driven operation mode on multi-dof models

Sartori M., Reggiani, M., Pagello E., Lloyd D.G., EMG-driven forward-
dynamic estimation of muscle force and joint moment about multiple degrees 
of freedom in the human lower extremity, Plos One, 7(12): e52618, 2012.

or if you use the EMG-assisted or static optimisation operation modes could you 
please cite

Sartori M., Farina D., Lloyd D.G. Hybrid neuromusculoskeletal modelling 
best tracks joint moments using a balance between muscle-excitations derived 
from EMG and optimization. Journal of Biomechanics 47(15): 3613–3621, 2014.

If possible we would also be grateful if you mention that CEINMS was funded by 
Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), the US National 
Institutes of Health (NIH), and the European Union Framework Programme 7 (EU FP7). 
We greatly appreciate this support, and the NHMRC, NIH and EU FP7 appreciate knowing 
that their funds are having an impact, particularly on medical research and human 
health.
