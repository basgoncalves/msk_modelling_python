CEINMS installation instructions
################################

Please use the provided installation packages for Linux and `Windows`_, according to your computer's architecture.

Windows
=======

Execute the 32-bit or 64-bit version of the installer according to your computer's architecture.
After you accept the licence agreement, you are shown the *Install Options* page. You should mark either ``Add CEINMS to the system PATH for all users`` or ``Add CEINMS to the system PATH for current user``, otherwise it will be cumbersome to execute CEINMS from the command prompt. The ``Create CEINMS Desktop Icon`` instead is currently useless: no icons will be created anyway, since there are no graphical interfaces.
You can proceed with the installation, selecting your preferred options for installation directory and *Start Menu* options.

Check your installation

Open a new command prompt and type::

You should read a brief help message. If this is not the case, please contact the developers.
